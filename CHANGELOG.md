## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-12

Initial public release.

### Added
- Local code graph for TypeScript / JavaScript codebases — index once, query cheaply.
- Sub-200ms agent hot path over `.ravel/` sidecars (cold CLI, existing index).
- CLI commands: `index`, `sync`, `watch`, `status`, `context`,
  `search`, `query`, `impact`, `hubs`, `cheatsheet`, `doctor`, `install`, `uninstall`.
- MCP server (`ravel mcp`) with 3 primary tools by default; `RAVEL_MCP_TOOLS=all` for the full set.
- One-shot agent wiring (`ravel install`) for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode,
  Gemini, Windsurf, VS Code, Grok, and more.
- Compact JSON output by default (`--pretty` for humans).
- Zero-config defaults with optional `.ravel.toml` overrides (extensions, ignore, sync).
- Git-optional operation: auto-sync when `.git` is present, `watch`/`sync <paths>` otherwise.
- Automatic entry-point detection for application entry files/controllers and `main.ts` / `bootstrap`.
- Install scripts (curl / PowerShell), npm distribution, and `cargo install` from source.
